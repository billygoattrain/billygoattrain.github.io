            <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>My mission is to be a steady presence for the people I loveâ€”someone they can count on
                   for support, joy, and inspiration. I strive to balance my mental, social, spiritual, and physical
                   well-being so I can be a role model who uplifts my family, friends, and girlfriend. Ultimately, I
                   aim to live as the kind of example that motivates future generations to build happy, fulfilling, and
                   successful lives.</p>
